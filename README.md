# sentimentanalysis
In the #first code, we separated positive and negative tweets for the "Twitter_samples" and calculated their evaluations precision and recall.
In the #second code, we get these evaluations for the "movie" corpus.
The #third code is almost similar to the first code, but instead of the "Twitter_samples" corpus, the "movie" corpus is used, which does not have good precision due to the imbalance of the data and inappropriate features, and because the training set is used instead of the test set Because the test set values ​​for naive bays were not enough for this code.
